            <h2>Myths about meditation</h2>
                <p>There is many myths about meditation that might stop you for even trying. To make your path easier I would like to bust some of the most common ones:</p>
                <h3>Myth #1: Your mind has to be quiet</h3>
                    <p>...Meaning you shouldn't have any thoughts going on in your head. During your meditation practice it is not about wether you have thoughts or not, but more about just being aware that you have them, whithout analyzing or getting attached with them. You can just sit back and notice your thougths come and go.</p>
                <h3>Myth #2: You need to sit still while meditating</h3>
                    <p>You might think that the only way to get into a meditative state is to sit down in a lotus position. That's not quite rigth, actually you can even meditate while hiking or walking in the nature.</p>
                <h3>Myth #3: Meditation takes hours</h3>
                    <p>You don't need to sit down(or walk) for an hour to benefit from meditation, even 5 minute break will count.</p>
